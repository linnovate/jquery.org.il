The module provides an API for creating and updating javascript dialog windows
using the jQuery UI Dialog widget and the CTools ajax framework. 



Using jQuery 1.6 (unsupported)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module has been designed to work with jQuery UI 1.7 and therefore requires
the jQuery Update module along with jQuery UI module.  If you would prefer to
use it with jQuery 1.6, simply remove the dependency line from the dialog.info
file.  Though there are reports that it works well enough with 1.6, this is 
definitely UNSUPPORTED functionality. Please only file an issue for this if you
are submitting a patch that would make it work for both versions.
